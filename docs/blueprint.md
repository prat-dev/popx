# **App Name**: Design Decoder

## Core Features:

- Code Suggestion: Generate code suggestions for components using the LLM tool based on descriptions or wireframes uploaded by the user. These suggestions can be copy-pasted directly into a Next.js project.
- Design Feedback: Provide intelligent feedback on design elements (such as typography, color palettes, layout) based on design uploads by the user. This gives less experienced designers feedback about best practices in UI design.
- File Upload: Upload area for design files (e.g., screenshots, wireframes, design mockups), with support for common image formats.
- Code Output Display: A dedicated 'code snippets' display section to render code generated from the AI.
- Feedback Display: Display of design feedback, with specific advice clearly highlighted.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid purple (#9F5DE2) to reflect creativity and forward-thinking.
- Background color: Light lavender (#F5F0FF), a lighter tint of the primary to create a soft background.
- Accent color: Bright teal (#5DE2D2) for highlights and calls to action, creating a sense of balance and innovation.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a clean, modern user experience
- Use flat, minimalist icons that align with the chosen color palette. Icons should be easily understandable and contribute to the modern feel.
- Clean, modern layout emphasizing whitespace and clear information hierarchy.
- Subtle transitions and animations to improve UX and give feedback to user interactions.
